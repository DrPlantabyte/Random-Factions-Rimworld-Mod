Property Notes: HugsLib.ModBase.*

.Logger

The Logger property allows a mod to write identifiable messages to the console. Error and Warning methods are also available. Calling:
Logger.Message("test");
will result in the following console output:
[ModIdentifier] test
Additionally, the Trace method of the logger will write a console message only if Rimworld is in Dev mode.

.ModIsActive

Returns true if the mod is enabled in the Mods dialog. Disabled mods would not be loaded or instantiated, but if a mod was enabled, and then disabled in the Mods dialog this property will return false.
This property is no longer useful as of A17, since the game restarts when the mod configuration changes.

.Settings

Returns the ModSettingsPack for your mod, from where you can get your SettingsHandles. See the wiki page of creating configurable settings for more information.

.ModContentPack

Returns the ModContentPack for your mod. This can be used to access the name and PackageId, as well as loading custom files from your mod's directory.

.HarmonyInstance

All assemblies that declare a class that extends ModBase are automatically assigned a HarmonyInstance and their Harmony patches are applied. This is where the Harmony instance for each ModBase instance is stored.

.HarmonyAutoPatch

Override this and return false if you don't want a HarmonyInstance to be automatically created and the patches in your assembly applied. Having multiple ModBase classes in your assembly will produce warnings if their HarmonyAutoPatch is not disabled, but your assembly will only be patched once.
